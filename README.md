<h2>Description:</h2>

Juicify is a Progressive Web Application, which is a coach in your pocket. It allows all functions like popular fitness application (for example MyFitnessPal), but also provides an opportunity of tracking workouts, watching other's people progress and the way they train. The main point of the app is analyzing user's way of eating and help individuals in achieving their body goals in the fastest and the most efficient way.As if that wasn't enough, it almost fully works in offline mode.

<h2>What am I proud of:</h2>

The biggest flex of the app is the way of handling offline synchronization. iOS does not support PWA background synchronization, but thanks to socket and Web workers, we can kind of avoid the issue, but delegating synchornization to work in background, when user uses the app. MongoDB as main database allow fast writing to DB, which is the most important part of "native experience". When user search in DB, Juicify supports it with cache methods like indexedDB and Redis, reusing previous queries's results.
