<h2>Description:</h2>

Juicify is a Progressive Web Application, which is a coach in your pocket. It allows all functions like popular fitness application (for example MyFitnessPal), but also provides an opportunity of tracking workouts, watching other's people progress and the way they train. The main point of the app is analyzing user's way of eatting and help him achieving body goals in the fastest and the most sience way. Not enough? It almost fully works in offline mode.

<h2>Nerd informations:</h2>

All the technology probably are not new for you, but what is the biggest flex of the app is the way it handles offline synchronization. iOS does not support PWA background synchronization, but thanks to socket, we can kind of avoid the issue. MongoDB as main database allow fast writting to DB, which is the most important part of "native experience". When user is forced to search in DB, Juicify supports it with cache methods like indexedDB and Redis, reusing previous queries's results from all users.
